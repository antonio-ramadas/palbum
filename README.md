### :man_shrugging: I still not did not get it

Consider this: you are in your car and playing a CD. Let's name it _Foo_. You're in the middle of it, but now you swap CDs. Some time later you decide to go back to the first CD (_Foo_), but you want to continue to listen the CD from the last track you were listening to. Well, now you have a problem, because you and your car don't remember your last track. **Palbum** fixes this by keeping track of the last tracks you heard.
